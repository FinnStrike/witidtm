This is the repo for course content for TCD's witidtm elective module.

We'll be using the TCD
[Blackboard](https://tcd.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/execute/courseMain?course_id=_56807_1)
tool for assignments etc. Apologies that only registered students can see that
material.

## Lecture/Labs Schedule

- Tuesday 1000-1050 online
- Thursday 1600-1750 online

We'll do an "office hours" session Monday's at 1100, just drop in
and chat as you want. (We can swap the timeslot later in the 
semester depending on how it conflicts with people's schedules.
