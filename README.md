# What is the Internet doing to me? (witidtm)

20210907 stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie

This is the repo for course content for TCD's witidtm elective module.
(TEU00311) The canonical URL for this is
[https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/).

We'll be using the TCD
[Blackboard](https://tcd.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_74933_1&content_id=_1983242_1)
tool for assignments etc. Apologies that only registered students can see that
material.

## Lecture/Online Session Schedule

It's almost all online for the start of the semester,
but hopefully we'll get face to face sessions in the
not too distant.

You can join sessions via 
the [blackboard collaborate ultra](https://tcd.blackboard.com/webapps/collab-ultra/tool/collabultra?course_id=_74933_1) 
tool.

Our regular lecture slots are:

- Tuesday 1000-1050 online
- Thursday 1600-1750 online

We'll do an "office hours" session on Monday's at 1100, just drop in to the
"Monday office hours" blackboard session, and chat as you want. We can swap the timeslot
later in the semester depending on how it conflicts with people's
schedules.

## Materials

Lecture content will accumulate [here](./lectures/2021-2022/) as we go.
Be aware that the content will change, even sometimes at the last minute!

You can look at the materials from last year [below](#oldlectureslides) or
the [2019 stuff here](./lectures/2019-2020/). 
This year's content will re-use some of that, likely modifed, and
some things will be new. 

You can also enjoy (heh:-) the 
[2020 recordings](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm-recordings/2020/) 
if you want. We might ask you to watch bits of those videos if that
seems like a way to increase the amount of class interaction. 
(We'll play that by ear, not sure yet if it'd work.)
