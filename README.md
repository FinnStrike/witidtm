# What is the Internet doing to me? (witidtm)

20210928 stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie

This is the repo for course content for TCD's witidtm elective module.
(TEU00311) The canonical URL for this is
[https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/).

We'll be using the TCD
[Blackboard](https://tcd.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/content/listContent.jsp?course_id=_74933_1&content_id=_1983242_1)
tool for assignments etc. Apologies that only registered students can see that
material.

## Lecture/Online Session Schedule

It's almost all online for the start of the semester,
but hopefully we'll get face to face sessions in the
not too distant.

You can join sessions via 
the [blackboard collaborate ultra](https://tcd.blackboard.com/webapps/collab-ultra/tool/collabultra?course_id=_74933_1) 
tool.

Our regular lecture slots are:

- Tuesday 1000-1050 online
- Thursday 1600-1750 ORI LG36 until Oct 14th with class split in two

We'll do an "office hours" session on Monday's at 1100, just drop in to the
"Monday office hours" blackboard session, and chat as you want. We can swap the timeslot
later in the semester depending on how it conflicts with people's
schedules.

## LG36 Labs

We'll be running lab-like sessions up to and including October 14th 
in the LG36 lab in the O'Reilly Institute building (the ORI). 

If you are bringing your own laptop (recommended) then you 
should try get that setup on the college network beforehand
if you can. 

If you can't bring a laptop, you can use a lab machine. You
should have gotten an email with a username/password for
that access around September 20th (or earlier) from the school of computer
science and statistics (SCSS). If you are taking some other
SCSS module, you may have gotten that email earlier. Please
check your spam folder, and have these credentials to hand
as you arrive for the session.

### Class Split Logistics

As the 1m distancing capacity of LG36 is 36 and we currently have
55 students registered for the module, we'll split into two groups,
one of which will use the 1600-1645 slot on Thursdays, which the
other group will use the 1700-1745 slot. We do have some ability
to swap from one group to the other, so if you'd prefer a swap,
email Stephen.

Meanwhile, <strong>we'll assign students with surnames starting with A to K
(inclusive) to the 1600 group, and other students to the 1700 group</strong>.

### Location

The campus map below shows the location of ORI LG36:

ORI LG36 is entered directly from outdoors on the ground level (to your left
before the steps up to the ORI main entrance) as shown by:

## Materials

Lecture content will accumulate [here](./lectures/2021-2022/) as we go.
Be aware that the content will change, even sometimes at the last minute!

You can look at the materials from last year [below](#oldlectureslides) or
the [2019 stuff here](./lectures/2019-2020/). 
This year's content will re-use some of that, likely modifed, and
some things will be new. 

You can also enjoy (heh:-) the 
[2020 recordings](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm-recordings/2020/) 
if you want. We might ask you to watch bits of those videos if that
seems like a way to increase the amount of class interaction. 
(We'll play that by ear, not sure yet if it'd work.)
