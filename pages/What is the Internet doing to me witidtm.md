This is the repo for course content for TCD's witidtm elective module.
(TEU00311) The canonical URL for this is
[https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/).  On
github, this is
[https://github.com/sftcd/witidtm](https://github.com/sftcd/witidtm).  The
content should be identical.

We'll be using the TCD
[Blackboard](https://tcd.blackboard.com/ultra/courses/_83782_1/cl/outline) tool
for assignments etc. Apologies that only registered students can see that
material.

We have a [policy](llm-policy.md) for use of AI tools when doing 
assignments.

Lecture slides etc are [below](#materials).

## Lecture/Online Session Schedule

This year the module is fully in-person, with no streaming and no recordings.

Our lecture slots are:

- Tuesday 1000-1050, Lloyd building, Lloyd 1.07
- Thursday 1600-1750, Lloyd building, Lloyd 1.07

We have labs in ORI LG36 on Thursday 21st and 28th September instead of
lectures.  [Here's](lectures/2022-2023/map-2-lg36.png) a map of TCD showing
where to find LG36, and [here's](lectures/2022-2023/oriLG.png) a diagram
showing where the door is (it's non-obvious:-).

We'll do an [online "office hour" session on Monday's at
1100](https://eu.bbcollab.com/guest/36c565c420804b70939bbc5ca9670e18), just
drop in to the "office hour" blackboard session, and chat as you want.
